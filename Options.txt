Py-abac:
Easy-to-write policies using JSON format rather than XACML. Can store in memory, SQL, or mongoDB.
Needs python >= 3.5

Vakt:
Again, easier to write policies than using straight XACML, little more in depth than Py-abac. Can store in memory,
SQL, or mongoDB. Needs python >= 3.4 Would be my go-to for a proof-of-concept, it's complex and fine-grain enough
to give plenty of control and is very well documented, but doesn't necessarily comply with OASIS XACML standards,
so probably would not be great for use in actual industry

Authforce server:
No example here (yet), but it's the way to go if I were to actually set this up in a large
infrastructure. Lots of support and documentation, complies with many standard.
But, it's much harder to set up than either of the above two, and may not be necessary if 
we are just showing a proof of concept.
May consider using Protege ontology editor to creat access control structures. Can export the file
as XACML to make writing the XACML much easiser
Will need OpenJDK8 and Tomcat8.
